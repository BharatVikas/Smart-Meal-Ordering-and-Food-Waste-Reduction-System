Our project aims to develop an integrated software and hardware solution to minimize food wastage in hostels while promoting student health. The system allows hostel messes to input daily meal options, enabling students to select their desired food items and quantities through a mobile app. This ensures that only the food they choose is prepared, significantly reducing waste. If a student forgets to make a selection, they receive a notification, and default options will be assigned if they do not respond. The app also tracks attendance during meal service, alerting hostel wardens if a student misses multiple meals, and prompting appropriate follow-up with the student and their parents if necessary.

Additionally, students can report food quality issues via the app, which will notify the food department for prompt resolution. Should problems persist, regulatory actions may be initiated to ensure compliance. To ensure proper serving of ordered food, a barcoding system using RFID is fixated near the food serving area, where, the scanner detects the ID number of the student's card, that shows their ordered meal. 

Finally, any leftover food can be purchased through the app to donate to food banks, supporting sustainability and community welfare. This comprehensive approach fosters accountability and cultivates a culture of health and generosity among students.
